## 📊 Current State Summary

### Automatic Differentiation
```
Current:  Zygote (AutoZygote())
Target:   Enzyme (AutoEnzyme())
Future:   Reactant (AutoReactant()) - optional
```

**Where used:**
- `src/algorithms/ppo.jl:62` - PPO learn! function
- `src/algorithms/sac.jl:396` - SAC learn! function

**Key dependencies:**
- Lux.Training.compute_gradients - already supports multiple AD backends
- ChainRulesCore - used for @ignore_derivatives macros

### Device Support
```
Current:  CPU only (standard Julia Arrays)
Target:   CPU, CUDA, ROCm, Metal
```

**What needs device support:**
- Buffers (RolloutBuffer, ReplayBuffer)
- Agents (ActorCriticAgent, SACAgent)
- Training loops (collect_rollout!, learn!)

## 📝 Documentation Standards

When implementing changes:

1. **Comment all device transfers**
   ```julia
   # Transfer batch to GPU for inference
   batch_device = to_device(batch, agent.device)
   ```

2. **Document type stability fixes**
   ```julia
   # Type stability fix: explicit type parameters to avoid runtime dispatch
   dists = Vector{DiagGaussian{T, typeof(means[1])}}(undef, length(means))
   ```

3. **Add docstrings for new functions**
   ```julia
   """
       to_device(x::AbstractArray, device::AbstractDevice) -> AbstractArray
   
   Transfer array `x` to the specified `device`.
   
   # Examples
   ```julia
   cpu_array = rand(Float32, 10, 10)
   gpu_array = to_device(cpu_array, CUDADevice(0))
   ```
   """
   ```

4. **Update README with examples**
   - Show device selection
   - Show AD backend selection
   - Performance guidelines

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Troubleshooting

1. **Check QUICK_START_ENZYME.md** troubleshooting section
2. **Review type stability** with JET.jl
3. **Try Zygote fallback** to isolate issues
4. **Check Lux.jl documentation** for AD backend compatibility

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| "Type instability detected" | Code not type-stable | See Day 5-7 in QUICK_START |
| "Enzyme compilation failed" | Unsupported operation | Use @ignore_derivatives or fallback |
| "CUDA not functional" | GPU issues | Check CUDA.jl setup |
| "Out of GPU memory" | Batch size too large | Reduce batch size |

## 🎓 Learning Path

### If you're new to Enzyme:
1. Read the Enzyme section in MIGRATION_REPORT.md
2. Try the basic tests in QUICK_START_ENZYME.md Day 1-2
3. Understand type stability requirements (Day 5)
4. Review Enzyme.jl documentation

### If you're new to GPU programming:
1. Read Multi-Device Support in MIGRATION_REPORT.md
2. Understand CPU-GPU data transfer costs
3. Review CUDA.jl tutorials
4. Start with small examples before full integration

### If you're familiar with both:
1. Jump straight to MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md
2. Follow the dependency matrix
3. Implement in parallel where possible
4. Focus on high-complexity items first

## 📅 Suggested Timeline

### Conservative (18 weeks)
- Phase 1: 4 weeks (with buffer for learning)
- Phase 2: 14 weeks (thorough testing)

### Moderate (14 weeks)
- Phase 1: 3 weeks
- Phase 2: 11 weeks

### Aggressive (11 weeks)
